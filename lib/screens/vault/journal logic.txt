Vault/Journal Logic
After login, show JournalScreen with all entries.

Vault is a special modal/page; first open prompts for PIN, then can view locked entries only if unlocked and “date to unlock” is reached.

Each journal entry requires a “date to unlock” before saving.

Optionally attach photo (use file_picker/image_picker for Windows).
