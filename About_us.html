    <p> About us (The Developer) <br>
         I am a solo developer who has created this app to help people with their mental health. <br>
         I have a passion for creating apps that make a difference in people's lives. <br>
         I believe that mental health is just as important as physical health, and I want to help people take care of their mental health. <br>
         I have created this app to be a safe space for people to reflect on their thoughts and feelings, and to help them grow and heal. <br>
         I hope that this app can help you on your mental health journey. <br>
         Thank you for using my app. <br>
