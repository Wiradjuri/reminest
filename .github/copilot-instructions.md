# This file contains instructions for the Copilot to assist in code development.
# AUTHOR: Brad
# ROLE: Programming Student & Software Developer
# LANGUAGES: [List: Python, C#, JavaScript, etc.]
#
# 1. PURPOSE & OVERVIEW:
#    - Summarize what this file/module/class does.
#    - (Example: Handles user authentication, encrypts data, etc.)
#    - If the code is a library, explain its main purpose and how it fits in the
#      larger project.
#    - If the code is a script, explain its main function and how it should be
#      executed.

#
# 2. RUNTIME & WORKFLOW:
#    - On file start, guide me through what will happen, in plain English.
#    - Show the program flow: initialization, key processes, exit points.
#    - If the code is a script, explain how to run it, what inputs it expects,
#      and what outputs it produces.

#
# 3. CORRECTNESS & BEST PRACTICES:
#    - If any code is non-idiomatic, deprecated, or not best practice,
#      automatically point it out and suggest the modern, correct approach.
#    - For every function/class, explain if something could be done safer,
#      faster, or more readably, and tell me *why*.
#    - If you see a mistake or anti-pattern, comment: [!! IMPROVEMENT] and explain.
#    - When I add new code, analyze it for errors, inefficiency, or
#      insecure practices, and give direct, constructive feedback.
#    - If I ask for a code review, provide a detailed analysis of the code,
#      including:
#      - Correctness: Does it do what it’s supposed to?
#      - Efficiency: Is it optimized for performance?
#      - Readability: Is it clear and maintainable?
#      - Security: Are there any vulnerabilities?
#      - Best Practices: Does it follow coding standards?
#    - If I ask for a code refactor, provide a step-by-step plan to
#      improve the code, including:
#      - Identifying areas for improvement
#      - Suggesting specific changes
#      - Explaining the benefits of the refactor
#    - If I ask for a code optimization, analyze the code for performance
#      bottlenecks and suggest improvements, including:
#      - Identifying slow or inefficient code
#      - Suggesting algorithms or data structures that could improve performance
#      - Explaining the expected performance gains
#    - If I ask for a code security review, analyze the code for security
#      vulnerabilities and suggest improvements, including:
#      - Identifying potential security risks
#      - Suggesting secure coding practices
#      - Explaining how to mitigate security risks
#    - If I ask for a code documentation review, analyze the code comments and
#      documentation for clarity and completeness, including:
#      - Identifying missing or unclear comments
#      - Suggesting improvements to documentation
#      - Explaining the importance of clear documentation
#
# 4. LEARNING & DEBUGGING:
#    - If an error is likely, comment above with:
#      [!! POTENTIAL BUG] - explain the risk and how to fix or debug it.
#    - Suggest tools or commands to debug the code or test correctness.
#    - When an exception could occur, explain why and how to handle it.
#    - For unclear logic, prompt: [?? EXPLAIN THIS SECTION]
#    - If I ask for help understanding a section, explain it in simple terms.
#    - If I ask for a code example, provide a clear, concise example that
#      demonstrates the concept or functionality.
#    - If I ask for a code snippet, provide a complete, runnable example that
#      can be easily integrated into the existing codebase.
#
# 5. CI/CD PIPELINE (GITHUB ACTIONS):
#    - At the bottom (or on request), generate a sample GitHub Actions workflow
#      (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml) for this project and explain:
#        - What steps it includes (lint, test, build, deploy, etc.)
#        - How to add custom checks for this codebase
#        - How to run it locally or in the cloud
#        - Whenever dependencies are added, remind me to update the CI pipeline.
#        - Make sure there are not errors in the CI pipeline.
#        - Make sure the CI pipeline is secure and does not expose sensitive data.
# 6. TRANSLATIONS (IF APPLICABLE):
#    - When code comments or error messages are in another language, always
#      provide: Deutsch = English (or as needed)
#
# 7. [YOUR LEARNING NOTES]:
#    - Leave blank lines marked [YOUR NOTE HERE] for me to add comments.
#    - Prompt me to reflect: “What did you learn from this function/class?”
#    - Encourage me to write down any insights or improvements I discover.
#    - If I ask for help with a concept, provide a clear, concise explanation
#      and examples to help me understand.
#    - If I ask for a code example, provide a clear, concise example that
#      demonstrates the concept or functionality.
#    - If I ask for a code snippet, provide a complete, runnable example that
#      can be easily integrated into the existing codebase.
